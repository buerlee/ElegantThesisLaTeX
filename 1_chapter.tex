\paragraph*{Outline}
\enlargethispage*{1cm}

This thesis is structured in the following manner:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textit{\Fref{chap:building_aerodynamics}} begins with an introduction to building aerodynamics and its theoretical background, covering the transition from previous methods for predicting natural ventilation potential.
	
	\item \textit{\Fref{chap:CFD}} will explain the basics of \gls{CFD} for the application of air flow modeling and provides an introduction into OpenFOAM, the tool used in this study.
	
	\item \textit{\Fref{chap:OF_custom_features}} explains the natural ventilation metrics which have been implemented in \OF\ and discusses their applicability for natural ventilation prediction.
	
	\item \textit{\Fref{chap:validation_&_verification_study}} is a validation  study for a simple scale model measured in the wind tunnel, which estimates errors and investigates the sensitivity of boundary conditions for a case setup.
	
	\item \textit{\Fref{chap:case_study_BRAC_U}} applies the findings from \fref{chap:validation_&_verification_study} to a case study---\BRAC. The goal is to provide design advice that would maximize the potential of natural ventilation over all classrooms on one floor of focus.
	
	\item \textit{\Fref{chap:outlook}} will provide a look into potential further developments, taking into account current limitations that have been identified.
\end{itemize}
